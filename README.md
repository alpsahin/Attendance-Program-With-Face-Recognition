# Attendance-Program-With-Face-Recognition

Face recognition is one of the most effective image processing applications and it is in an
important place among the technical areas. Face recognition is a problem for authentication
purposes especially for students. Face recognition attendance system is a procedure of recognizing students by using face biostatistics based on high definition monitoring and other
computer technologies. The development of this system is aimed to achieve taking place
of the traditional system of taking attendance by calling names or signing a paper. These
techniques are boring, time-consuming, and not reliable due to proxy signs. Therefore, this
project focuses on all those problems, by explaining several existing approaches and demonstrating the implementation of them.
